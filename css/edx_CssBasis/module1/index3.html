      In unit 2.3, we defined a CSS selector as the portion of the CSS rule that
      tells the browser on which HTML element to apply the defined style. When
      your HTML is simple, the selectors can be simple as well. The most basic
      selectors simply mirror the HTML tag. For example "p" attaches to all
      &lt;p&gt; tags, "img" will attach to all &lt;img&gt; tags and so on. As
      you can imagine, there will often be times when you don't want every
      single HTML element of a particular type to have identical style. In
      Module 3, we'll discuss a variety of ways to use selectors to attach to
      specific HTML elements. In unit 2.2, we briefly mentioned the fact that
      properties apply to the entire hierarchy of HTML elements to which they
      are attached. This means that you will have to be very careful which
      selectors you choose to use in combination with your chosen style. When
      choosing your selector you might want to keep the following aspects of an
      HTML element in mind
    </p>
    <h2>Sub Title 1</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>How many of these HTML elements are on my page?</li>
      <li>Do I want this style to apply to every one of these elements?</li>
      <li>What are this HTML element's children</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Sub Title 2</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>and do I want this style to apply to them as well?</li>
      <li>Is this element a block element or an inline element</li>
      <li>and does this style make sense in that context?</li>
    </ol>
