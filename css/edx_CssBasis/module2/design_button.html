    <!-- Effective titles and buttons
        Now that you know a bit more about how CSS is written, you will start to understand and notice more of the design elements as you navigate around the Web. 
        
        In this module's style studies section, you learned some effective ways to style titles and buttons. You also learned about some design choices that make your titles and buttons not as effective...
        
        Titles shouldn't be overly styled. They should only have a few properties set to help them stand out from body text, but not too many otherwise they will be too busy.
        Buttons should send a clear message that they need to be interacted with. If a button doesn't show up as a rectangle, a user typically won't understand that it's a button. -->

        Font-size sets the overall scale of your text. You can use a lot of
        different units to set the font size. Some of these units you are
        probably familiar with if you have used text editors before such as pt
        size or you can use px size. However, these methods are not advised
        because they are static and will not adapt based on screen size.

        This property sets the font face. There are a collection of Web safe
        fonts that generally each browser has agreed to support, but there is an
        infinite number of different fonts. The problem is they might not all
        look the way you want them to on different browsers.

        That is why this property "font-family" allows a list of fonts in the
        order of your preference. This comma-separated list orders your font
        preference from left to right. In our above example, our first choice is
        Helvetica, if the browser doesn't support that it will move to the next
        on the list, Verdana, and if it still doesn't support that it will just
        pick any sans-serif font it does support. You should always end your
        font family with fonts that are likely to be supported by the browser,
        this way I am guaranteed to have control over the font-family.

        Something to keep in mind: some fonts have names with multiple words
        like "Times New Roman" or "Century Gothic". When using these fonts
        you'll need to surround the entire name with quotes so the browser
        understands that is a single font name
