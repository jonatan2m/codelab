More about ".vue" Files and the CLI
Section 6, Lecture 88
The ".vue" File

You can learn more about ".vue" Files in this Article from the official Docs: http://vuejs.org/guide/single-file-components.html

Learn more about the render()  method in another Article in the official Docs: http://vuejs.org/guide/render-function.html

Finally, it's important to be aware of the fact, that you can also load your App.vue File (your main Component/ Instance) via the following two Ways (Alternatives to render() ):

1) Using the ES6 Spread Operator (for that, you need to add babel-preset-stage-2 as a Dependency and to your .babelrc File):

npm install --save-dev babel-preset-stage-2 

.babelrc:

{
  "presets": [
    ["es2015", { "modules": false }],
    ["stage-2"]
  ]
}


import Vue from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
 
new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  ...App
});


2) Using mount() :

Also install the stage-2 preset as described above.

import Vue from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
 
const vm = new Vue({
  ...App
});
 
vm.$mount('#app');


The CLI

Learn more about the CLI here: https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli

Local CSS / Sass Files and CLI Templates

The webpack-simple template doesn't support local CSS or Sass files, because no CSS loader is set up.

Use the webpack template (not webpack-simple) to get this functionality: https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack

Debugging VueJS Projects
Section 6, Lecture 89
There are two main Tools you may use:

1) The Developer Tools in Chrome (see below)

2) The Vue Developer Tools (https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools)

When working with a Project created by the CLI (using Webpack!), you can easily debug your running Application by opening your Developer Tools (see below in Chrome) and going to "Sources" there. 

You should see a "Webpack" folder which you may open to see all your files included in the project (see image below, in orange box).

You can open any file there and set breakpoints etc. to debug your running application.
